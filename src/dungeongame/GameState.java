This too is a Singleton class with an instance() method. It may be the hardest 
of the seven to wrap your head around. The GameState object simply represents 
"the current state of the game," which means the information pertaining to the 
status of the user's experience at a certain point in time. For now, all it 
knows is (1) which dungeon is being played, and (2) what room the adventurer is 
currently in. When the GameState is initialized with a Dungeon, it should set 
the current room to be the dungeon's entry point.
